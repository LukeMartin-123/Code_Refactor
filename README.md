# Code-Refactor

# Description
We were tasked with optimizing and increasing the accessibility of the existing code for the home page of the Horiseon Marketing group. To do this I started by ensuring that all the images had alt tags to allow for better accessibility. From there I then worked to update and clean up the code to make it more in-line with HTML5 guidelines. This included removing "div classes" in things like the header, footer and other aspects fo the HTML code. I then adjusted the css code to match and work with the updated HTML code.
